"A Certain Romance"

"Shall I keep rolling?"

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up

And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!

"Bigger Boys And Stolen Sweethearts"

There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's so clear you were though

Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys but, never went very far
And she wagged English and science just to go in his car

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh now the girls have grown
Yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know

"Choo Choo"

My baby wants to drive the train
But don't you let her, don't you let her touch the tracks
I said my baby wants to drive the train
Well all aboard yeah, and don't forget to mind the gap
Don't you let her, don't you know
She's sick and tired of
Being in the background, the passenger
Let her drive the train, oh!

Choo Choo!
Why don't you let her drive the train?
Choo Choo!
Why don't you let her drive the train, yeah

She's setting off from platform four
Make your way down, we'll shut the door bout quarter to five
I said she's setting off from platform four
And they've decided that they're gonna let her drive

Don't you let her, don't you know
She's sick and tired of
Being in the background, the passenger
Let her drive the train, oh!

Choo Choo!
Why don't you let her drive the train, oh...
Choo Choo!

With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you...

He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice

The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and

Smacking a bloke here tonight

Get out the way, mister

From tourists in trafalgar square

"Dancing Shoes"

Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

...the lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

But don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And I said the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

"Fake Tales Of San Francisco"

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom

There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rock stars in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you no
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
Oh, she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank
And I'm not having a nice time"

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you no
(Kick me out, kick me out)
Yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
Yeah, I'm sure it's pretty far

Yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham

"Mardy Bum"

Well now then Mardy Bum
I've seen your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Well can't we just laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

And yeah I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs,
Oh, when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah, I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

"On The Run From The MI5"

Come and take a leaf out of my book
I'm a crack dealing crook
Selling lots of rock and roll to the masses
And I know if you wanna take a trip to the city
We can go (to Gibraltar)

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

"Riot Van (Demo)"

We got thrown in a riot van
And the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

Smoked a bong a last night
And stole somebody's telephone
He thinks it's all alright
But they've left him on his own, on his own

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

Pinched a car with one headlight
And lost control the passengers were screaming
Made him shut his eyes right tight
And think of you, and hope that he was dreaming

Then up rolled the riot van
And called the fire brigade
But it was already too late
And there was no arrests to make
Ohhhhh!

But baby stop calling
Over and over yeah
And give me some funny cigarettes
And do what they told you, yeah

"Scummy"

So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
Sorry love I'll have to turn you down

And oh he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She understands she's here to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and...

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all

"Still Take You Home"

Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact
That everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright
Yeah, I'll put it on one side
'Cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes, including mine

"Wavin' Bye To The Train Or The Bus"

Oh baby, I'm wanting to do you a swap

In return for the noises you've got
And I can see you want to be attended to
Just count to twenty-nine and I'll attend to you
Oh for sure... well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...

So very comfortable..
Don't really need to put up my feet,
And even in fat sam's grand slam,
Can't see it being easier to speak.
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
And I'm a memory and don't know what to do
All on his own...
Collecting his dole n' stuff

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...
Cause we know
Yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
Oh we know, a woah-oh-oh

Don't know where we're going, baby
I s'pose it depends
But even if we're all far apart
We can all come back and all be fine
We'll be able to be together again

Be together again
Be together again
Be together again
...
Everybody will be together again!

"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor"

Stop making the eyes at me,
I'll stop making the eyes at you.
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
I don't know what you're looking for

Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because it's sending me to despair,
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand

Dirty dance floors, and dreams of naughtiness!

Sick of looking at you strange
Sick of sticking to the floor

If they keep on pushing you around
If they keep on stepping on your toes

Said not one of you, no

"The View From The Afternoon"

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns and how

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block
Owt you send her after nine o'clock

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

"You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring Straight At Me"

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces

They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, my heart beats at its peak,
When you're coming up to speak

And oh I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer?
And I'm talking gibberish,
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it

...Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone, yeah

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks, yeah

Never again, never again, oh, will there be another one quite as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces

"Riot Van"

Up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got a chase last night from men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong, still ran away though for the laugh, just for the laugh

"And please just stop talking
'Cause they won't find us if you do.
Oh, those silly boys in blue.
Well, they won't catch me and you."

"Have you been drinking, son? You don't look old enough to me."
"I'm sorry, officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be? 'Cause nobody told me."

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured"

We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up at our end aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no, though
He didn't have to be rude
You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Well how come it's already two-pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous?
She were beyond belief
But this lad at the side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting
I were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few
Well, calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
Oh, they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
He said "No surrender
No chance of retreat"

And so why are they in the taxi?
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please!"

Drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, "Are you sure?"
Went for it but the red light was showing
And red light indicates doors are secure

"Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But..."

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan
Has he got one

You better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher
And I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise
But it's true
Said I'm not like you

And I don't want your advice
Or your praise or to move in the ways
You do, and I never will

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Well I've seen your eyes
As they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending

Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we get in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said I can't believe
That you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you?
How much did they pay ya?

You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires!

"When The Sun Goes Down"

I said, "Who's that girl there?"
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
Yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition,
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"

He must be up to something
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It doesn't stop in the winter, no

And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all

"From The Ritz To The Rubble"

Last night these two bouncers and one of em's alright
The other one's the scary
And his way or no way, totalitarian

He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he don't want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay

And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?

He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think he wants it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

And, that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to what you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

I said last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

"Cigarette Smoker Fiona"

Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues
The dignity fucks off

Her brother's gone off to the strippers
To make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches
But she's actually alright

(Cigarette smoker)
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
How much you've had but
(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

A country home, even if we really tried
What if it's just surprises now?
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back? d'you know?

Well I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well-spoken girls in stilletoes
Aren't something to fear

(Cigarette smoker)
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
How much you've had but
(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

[Instrumental]

(Cigarette smoker)
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
How much you've had but
(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

(Cigarette smoker)
Cigarette smoke doesn't hide
As well as you think
And you'd think that it oughta
Act as the perfect disguise

"Despair In The Departure Lounge"

He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up, because
It just won't happen

He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
Ill

Yesterday I saw a girl
Who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all

And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
...Ill

Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me

"No Buses"

Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But, when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
No chance, you'll get nothin' from me
But now she's there, you're there, everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
Just like me

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in 24
And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
Does that mean that I can, too?

Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the anti-septic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must be first, be in demand
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in 24
And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
Does that mean that I can, too? Oh...

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want, or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her
And that's why she's after him
But sayin' it wont change a thing
And they'll realise that it wont change a thing
Realise that it wont change a thing

"Who The FucK Are Arctic Monkeys?"

We all want someone to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all, or is it just paranoia?

Everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your derides or individes
Will never unhinge us

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before ya

Just cause we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be playdoh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?"

'Cause everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your derides or individes
Will never unhinge us

[Instrumental]

(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)

All the thoughts that I just said
Will linger round and multiply in their head
Not that mad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues...

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash!

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue
It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape?

"Leave Before The Lights Come On"

Well this is a good idea,
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't,
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one.
Well my friend fancies you,
Oh what a way to begin it all,
You said, "They're always exciting words to hear."

And they woke up together not quite realising how,
Awkwardly stretching and yawning,
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay,
Well oh it isn't what it was,
She's thinking he looks different today,
And now there's nothing left to guess now,

They left before the lights came on,
Because they didn't want to ruin,
What it was that was brewing,
Before they absolutely had to,
And how can you wake up,
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly fazed by it,
Oh, he had a struggle,

And they woke up together not quite realising how,
Awkwardly stretching and yawning,
It's always hard in the morning,

And I suppose that's the price you pay,
Well oh it isn't what it was,
She's thinking he looks different today,
And now there's nothing left to guess now,

Well, quick, let's leave, before the lights come on,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
What you've done...

Well, quick, let's leave, before the lights come on,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
What you've done...

I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out.

"Put Your Dukes Up, John"

Just put your dukes up, John,
Yeah, put your dukes up, John,
You were preened and sanitized
Struck dumb by good advice

Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracized him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John,)
(Be a C-Y-N-I-C)

"Baby I'm Yours"


Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky,
Yours, until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die


Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines,
Yours, until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time


I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world could drive me away
'Cause every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until two and two is three,
Yours, until the mountains crumble to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours
(Til the stars fall from the sky)
Baby, I'm yours
(Til the rivers all run dry)
Baby, I'm yours
(Til the sun no longer shines)
Baby, I'm yours
(Til the poets run out of rhymes)

"Brianstorm"

Brian
Top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted

And I wonder are you puttin' us under
Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet but she's yours

She'll be sayin' use me
Show me the Jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your high rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

Calm, collected, and commandin'
(Top marks for not tryin')
You leave the other story standin'
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes that have wept cause you've stolen their ...thunder
Are you puttin' us under

Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator

"Teddy Picker"

They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punch-line before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

They've sped up to the point where they provoke you
To tell the fucking punch-line before you have told the joke
"Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list"

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

Saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says that we are defenders
Of any poser or professional pretender around

When did your list
Replace the twist and turn like a fist
Replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Presuming that all things are equal?
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?

"D Is For Dangerous"

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded

The guiltyness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for...

Desperately trying to stimulate what it was that was alright
3 quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

"Balaclava"

Running off over next door's garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun

The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
With the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny make-up alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you'll wish you'd never been born

You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway
'Cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start

The confidence is the balaclava,
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong wrong wrong,
She can hardly wait

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime!

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight

Will you be able to boast
Of the day of the most
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble
Right before the very first kiss
Quiet, unassuming,
But you heard that they were the naughtiest

She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather
Keep on the balaclava.

"Fluorescent Adolescent"

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem,
My love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again.

you're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
We're just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
(falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
(we're sounding it out)
Everything was pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(but you're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

"Only Ones Who Know"

In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somebody could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know

"Do Me A Favour"

Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour and break my nose!
Do me a favour and tell me to go away!
Do me a favour and stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind,
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind

"This House Is A Circus"

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
There's a,

Room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping to familiar ways

And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around and it's so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

"If You Were There, Beware"

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no thank yous and nobody flinches
Go on girl go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart

Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give

"The Bad Thing"

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore
Well, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't she murmurs things to confirm
That the tragedy is true
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Really love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse

"Old Yellow Bricks"

Old yellow bricks,
Love's a risk,
Quite the little Escapologist
Looked so miffed,
When you wished,
For a thousand places better than this,

You are the fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she deemed dull,
Lead to nights reading beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasn't all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from,

She said, "I want to sleep in a city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?" but
Dorothy was right though

"505"

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile

"Da Frame 2R"

007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting there ‘selves because there’s another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

He’s certainly come into his own,
There’s one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it’s boring to him
It’s a war you can’t win and the first and the last are two things you’ll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldn’t the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she’s going
But don’t know where she’s been
And as opposed to the ‘other thing’
He’ll worry about it when it’s trouble he’s in

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it’s boring to him
It’s a war you can’t win and the first and the last are two
Things you’ll never be my darling

Things you’ll never be my darling

(Two things you will never be my darling)

(Two things you’ll never be my darling)

They sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(But not for this kid, not when they come to you.)

"Matador"

She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl,
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several once
A terrible dilemma and forever he’ll regret this day he didn’t make the
Rescue from the bull ring
Sulking won’t get you nowhere son,
There’s blood on your chin where you’ve bitten your tongue
Smitten but might not be smitten for long if you’re still sitting she’ll soon
Be smitten and gone

"My Propeller"

If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink in to tomorrow
Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller

"Crying Lightning"

Outside the café by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick'n'mix

Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your pasttimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I loved that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past times consisted of the strange
Twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"

Your past times consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called "Crying..."

"Dangerous Animals"

I'm pinned down by the dark

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well told gripe
The most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
You sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through, the thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And of course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyone's heart.

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet, it's been long enough now so let's make a mess lioness

Pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L

"Secret Door"

Fools on parade cavort and carry on
For waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration
To be attempted on a Wednesday night
It's better than to get a reputation
As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along

Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant, was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along
And even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

As all the fools on parade
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind
To be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade
Frolic and fuck about to make a gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture
That holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along

"Potion Approaching"

I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms

It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean
(Yours is the only ocean)
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on

I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd still spend it chasing after you
Cos she's not shattering my attitude
No matter how she folds the potion

Yours is the only ocean
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

I'm swinging on
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean

Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes
Potion Approaching
Visualize
Holding a token
Swollen in size
Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes

Oh but if we're going to escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go kart?

"Fire And The Thud"

You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer

But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter, and tell you how it feels?

And does burden come to meet you
If I've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel

The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
The concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

In the jostling crowd
You're not allowed
To tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar!

There's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to enquire

I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
They'd never see if it smacked them in their temples

"Cornerstone"

I thought I saw you in The Battleship but it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast when I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook, huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look and kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close and she held me very tightly until I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak and she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I saw your sister in The Cornerstone on the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own I thought she might understand
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but, yes, you can call me anything you want"

"Dance Little Liar"

I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend the guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar

It's just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction on your lips
And dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes that will get you back to normal

And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch the varnish off
That newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt in between the dirt

"Pretty Visitors"

Trudging through the morning and the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, shifts past your whiskers so stark is the charm but the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round in your muddy mind blatantly caked and unwilling to wind uncooperative time so he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk, your legs start running and your head gets caught

Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold there's a crook in the hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold there's a crook in the hammock plays cruelly with the base of the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

"The Jeweller's Hands"

Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek

You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless and weightless your imagination runs

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit was like falling off the ferry in the night

The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
It became laughter's assassin shortly after he showed you what it was

And now it's no ones fault but yours, at the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

"She's Thunderstorms"

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me
This kind of acrobatic blood
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms

"Black Treacle"

Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side

And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just in case

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?

And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

And now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the sundance kid behind the synthesiser
And I tried last night to pack away a laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle

"Brick By Brick"

I wanna build you up (Brick by brick)
I wanna break you down (Brick by brick)
I'm gonna reconstruct (Brick by Brick)
I wanna feel your love

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

I wanna steal your soul (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick by Brick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

I want a brick by brick (Brick by brick)
I want a blow by blow (Brick by brick)
I want an episode (Brick by brick)
I want a brick by brick, by brick, by

Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala"

Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

And in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The Devil's pedicure
What you waiting for
Sing another fucking shalalala

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

"Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair"

Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors
Through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well known hard man
And start a fight
Wear your shellsuit
On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah

Bite the lightning
And tell me how it tastes
Kung Fu fighting
On your rollerskates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah

"Library Pictures"

I'm in a vest

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo!

Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
We're going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Give me an eanie, meanie minie mo
Or an ip, dip, dog shit rock and roll

"All My Own Stunts"

Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind all the time

I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
High noon has changed its tune
Linking arms, sinking hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

'Cause I'm from High Green
I'm from High Green

"Reckless Serenade"

Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
And now I'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade

"Piledriver Waltz"

I etched a face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Mysteries flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes

I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Ohh, piledriver

"Love Is A Laserquest"

Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness

And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make believe

And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?

"Suck It And See"

Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just postmix lemonade

Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt girl that's a sawn off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

"That's Where You're Wrong"

A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name than love by numbers
Street lamp amber wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong

"The Blond-O-Sonic Shimmer Trap"

Black as a beacon
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was

If you were heat-seeking
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
That knows

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like a niccy rush but she stings like a B-flat
The Blond-o-Sonic Shimmer Trap

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

"Do I Wanna Know?"

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?

"R U Mine?"

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island,
Time-traveling diamond
Cutter shaped heartaches
Come to find you
Four in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say
Is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days
Great escape
Lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine? Mine?)

And the thrill of the chase
Moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say
"You got me, baby. Are you mine?"

She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?)

"One For The Road"

One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road, ooh ooh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

"Arabella"

Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round the Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like...

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

"I Want It All"

Blind faith
Heartache
Mind games
Mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

Shoo wop shoo wop shoo wop shoo wah

I want it all

"No.1 Party Anthem"

So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah

The look of love - the rush of blood
The "She's with me" 's - the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
The black and white - the colour dodge
The good time girls - the cubicles
The house of fun - the number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah

"Mad Sounds"

Mad sounds in your ears make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up

Yeah, they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds in your ears make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long reappear
Make you get up and dance

Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la la...
(Ooh la la la la...)

You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears make you get up and dance
Well don't they make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up

"Fireside"

I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?"

The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (hey)
Well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply (message you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high? (why'd you only call me when you're high?)
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here wonder where I might?
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said, "You gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

"Snap Out Of It"

What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth…

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

"Knee Socks"

You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough-drop-coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phone book I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could Be My Baby


(All the zeros lined up but the number's blocked when you've come undone)

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

"I Wanna Be Yours"

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours...

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
I just wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours
(Wanna be yours)

"Star Treatment"

I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it's ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, long, hot summer
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
It's the star treatment
The star treatment

"One Point Perspective"
(Live Version)

Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band and all
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come here kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasize I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

"Singsong 'round the money tree"
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe, I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

"American Sports"

So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on ‘Parliament Brawl’
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on video call

Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of "You don't know what you're doing"

And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lolas

And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas

"Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino"

Jesus in the day spa filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done
Just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please tell me how may I direct your call?

This magical thinking
Feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances
Really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please tell me how may I direct your call?
Do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please tell me how may I direct your call?

"Golden Trunks"

Last night when my psyche's subcommittee sang to me in it's scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

The leader of the free world reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

In the daytime, bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasize about you too

"Four Out Of Five"

Advertise in imaginative ways
Start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike
It is that easy

Lunar surface on a Saturday night
Dressed up in silver and white
With coloured "Old Grey Whistle Test" lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus
It's all getting gentrified

I put a taqueria on the roof
It was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the starlight express
The head of special effects
In my mind's eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget
Doesn't time fly?

I'm in no position to give advice
I don't wanna be nice
And you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise
The old headquarters

All the nights that never happened
And the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
Only time that we stop laughing
Is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus
It's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio
(The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Now, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon
(The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five

(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five

The World's First Ever Monster Truck Front Flip"

You push the button and we'll do the rest
The exotic sound of data storage
Nothing like it
First thing in the morning
You push the button and we'll do the rest
Bastard latin
That's the best thing for it
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

Pattern language in the mood for love
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and genie wearing stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

The world's first ever monster truck front flip
I'm just a bad girl trying to be good
I've got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

Forward thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest

"Science Fiction"

Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's ungloved
And it's on its way back in to scoop you up
Not on my watch

I want to stay with you my love
The way some science fiction does

Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing

I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
The way some science fiction does

I've got the world on a wire in my little mirror mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does

"She Looks Like Fun"

One, two, three, four

She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like

Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable N.Y.E

(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)

Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, because they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online
As of March
I'm so full of shite, I need to spend less time stood around in bars waffling on to strangers
All about martial arts
And how much I respect them

(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)

"Batphone"

I want an interesting synonym to describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

"The Ultracheese"

Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway and his sons
Because it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just trying to orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone because you have the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once

Oh...

"2013"

Well the times are so a'changing
Baby even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind

You knew it would go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh there's nothing you can't find

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you

As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah) Yeah

So baby take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy

"7"

Well I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Was gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all

Well I'm looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You probably didn't give me the eye but I'm sure you did

Well I went outside
Couldn't say I tried
And I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet

But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well I dashed around tried to find you
But you were, nowhere to be seen
Oh no no...

(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)

Well she moved in ways, that kept her there
In our minds for days
And weeks and months
I was that amazed
And there she stayed
Surrounded by the what if's and the maybe's

"Anyways"

Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
Putting a world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes
Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
Exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, you go hard in the paint
It's just another race to anyways

Philanthropic toga party
What a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave
Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face
Oh, come all by the fire, babe, let's all participate
In yet another race to anyways
Oh, how's your Mum and Dad been doing with the generation gap?

Yeah, I'm behind my movie camera
I've got my megaphone
You can call me Alexander
It's nice to meet you all

Listening to the Shipping Forecast
Driving to the airport
Me and the guys
Metropolis ablaze in the rear view
Devising methods to both have and eat your cake
Mmm, just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake
You look as if you know exactly what I'm gonna say
Is just another race to
Anyways

"Bad Woman"

When you left the house this evening,
You said you'd be back in a little while
Well I've been waiting for such a long time,
And this wait is driving me wild...

And while I wait I think about you,
Do you need me when I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new attract?

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman

If he is on you...
It keeps flashing through my mind,
If you would only call,
If you would be so kind.
Imagine things,
I see another man
And it's this waiting I just can't stand...

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman

"Catapult"

Both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I'll go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone

It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw, it's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tear you out the day after a triumph is as hollow
As the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'Bye'

And you would queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl bluff
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let them join the club

He knows how to put a cork in the fuss
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try

You cannot turn away

"Don't Forget Whose Legs You're On"

In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
A moment more
And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enchancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size

"Electricity"

Darlin’ tell me something I don’t know
Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me
I forget how I want it
That electricity

My heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

Love like locked horns
Love like dominos
Be my midnight
Be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it
How it crept up on me
It takes over
Electricity

And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

Separated
There I face it
Love like thunder
Love like falling snow

Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

"Evil Twin"

You've never met before,
But still she greets you like a long lost rock-and-roll.
She's definitely one of those,
But you'll go wherever she goes.

And when my body and my mind
Both start talking at the exact same time,
Tryna think of ways to make her mine,
But they're difficult to find.

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give it to me.

She said,

"Oh, well, I know this will sound cold,
But I really have to go.
Oh, it's not that I'm not free.
There's nowhere I need to be.
It's just your love's not what I need.
So, don't give it to me."

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need.
So, don't give to me.

She said, "Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?"
No point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck.

It's more a hunger than a thirst.
She'll break your heart the second time
Before you know about the first.
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch,
But you'd let her do her worst.

And it's not hard to tell.
It's obvious the other angels faces fell,
When she told them that she had to go,
Swap her wings and overcoat for something colourful.

Bad news.

It's not what I need.
No, your love's not what I need.
So, don't give to me.

No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need,
So, don't give to me.
No, your love's not what I need.

"Fright Lined Dining Room"

You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And all the curtain leads to fever

We watched the womanizer cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Convey excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merry men
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock


And the tumble splits the fray
Revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast


The days drag their heels
When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brats

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowels hide and wait to rot away
The identities of the willing


Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shutter doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

You can itch, flap and whistle
And try to avoid the top
As I scribbled over dribble
You were snoring, showing off


The tumble splits the frays
Revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

"Hold On, We're Going Home"
(originally by Drake)

I got my eyes on you
You’re everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You put your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

Yeah
I got my eyes on you
You’re everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

You're the girl
You’re the one
Gave you everything I love
You think that’s something baby
You think that’s something baby
You're the girl
You’re the one
Gave you everything I love
You think that’s something baby
You think that’s something baby

So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
Yeah
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
So just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home

"I Haven't Got My Strange"

When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your stories slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic

It's arguable that i shouldn't have been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favorite coat
And my love dropped into the lining

(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me, I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me

You can't sleep 'til you've sat on the steps to weep
'Til you feel like you've wept, yeah

(As long as you don't forget your strange)
(Have you got your strange?)
No not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
I haven't got my strange
I better fetch my strange
I haven't got my strange
I haven't got my strange

"If You Found This It's Probably Too Late"

Under constant correction, a fraud, a fraud
Someone's perception, trying not to bore
I'm a cold-hearted kidder, applaud, applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours

You figure out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette
We think out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette

And if you found this, it's probably too late
Clinically cynical, hereditary hate
If you found this it's probably too late
Approaching the pinnacle, I'm running out of mates

If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready, but probably rough
Frightened that honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff

"Joining The Dots"

Try and think of something colourful for this season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all I have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain's trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

Those people make me calm
Can't the flame
Come up to the moth for a change
And darling if it's all the same to you
I'll have you to myself
I'm joining the dots.
I'm joining the dots.

"Little Illusion Machine (Wirral Riddler)"
(feat. Miles Kane)

[Miles Kane:]
Swinging room to room
Planting something new
I've ridden the riddle, I'll do it again
Back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

Riding through the gloom
Something beautiful

He's ridden the riddle, he'll do it again
He's going back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

I tried it and I liked it but
It just never gets close enough

[Both:]
Send a letter to me, baby

(Wirral)
So tell me where have you been?
(Wirral)
Little illusion machine
(Wirral)
Hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

Wooow!

"Nettles"

Sank into their calculations and snorted on a stench
A bare arithmetic
Look for the boy who was hanging his head low
More trophies and ideas
To follow their pretend

With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles

I flew in some spiky whispers and he bought his own rope
And skipped against the rode
Did start not to find the dark lead and catch that man i hope
Devices man are closed
He lost all his foot holes

And with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles,
Fell in the nettles,
Fell in the nettles

He was a toothpick and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
Failed to blunt or hinder, a slow collapse
And clinging to the door frame he was trapped
After a reminder of where he had been

With a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face
There was nowhere to flee
Just had to tent in the nettles

"Only You Know"

I want to see something that used to be in your eyes again
I'm waiting to see it you know it's only a question of when
And I know how much I'm missing heaven
You know that its missing

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

I know it's not easy for you to start to believe again
And when the day comes don't let yourself be deceived again
Cause I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

And I know how you've been waiting
Such a long time that you've been waiting

And only you know
Where you have been to
Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into
And I want to be there too

"Plastic Tramp"

He looks as if he hasnt slept, his hair is purposely unkept
And then he knew his people wept, when you crafted your plan
The shadows underneath the eyes, and everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of Proof is your disguise, you won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game,
This world is cruel and most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, you're conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination,
Lying again you're conscious ain't your friend and the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination
Is he really on the street, desperation on deceit and what he's wearing on his feet won't solve our mystery,

And I am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin, better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes, everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of Proof is your disguise, you won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say, but sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game,
This world is cruel and is most unkind
And horrible is redefined, I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
You're lying again, your conscious ain't your friend
And the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination,
Lying again your conscious ain't your friend and the only thing your sobbing out is your imagination

"Red Right Hand"

Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks

Where secrets lie in the border fires
And the humming wires
Well you know you're never coming back
Past the square past the bridge
Past the mills past the stacks

On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms
And tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy

He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru

They're whispering his name
Across this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

You don't have no money
He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car
He'll get you one
You've got no self respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
Cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
And the bowery and the slums

A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere
But he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and on the TV screen
Hey buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru

You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand

"Settle For A Draw"

Well I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your Jerry can of words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?

Well you're right it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And lets not fall in the trap
Of answering back
I am just a beginner
But she'll be the only winner
That's for sure
So take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire don't get out your jerry can of words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?

"Sketchead"

Sketchead
He's coming to your party
He's walking up your drive
And he's swinging all his keys round
Sketchead
He's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend retain your introductions
Sketchead
That cunts a protagonist
The pips in your quince
They are behind the spoil
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

Sketchead
There's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits
And leave you to your wits
Sketchead
Convincingly insisting the tyres were bald
When you gave him the car
Sketchead
Still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive
And still swinging all his keys round on his finger
As a pendulum to un nerve

And then there's you
You've changed
I approach you like you were the same
But soon it was apparent a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your limbs is obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that
They don't prefer the sequel
Will still be swinging on themselves tonight

"Stop The World I Wanna Get Off With You"

Open Sesame
(We've places to go)
We've people to see
(Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you had to escape, say the word

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move and you'll probably be leaving soon
So I'm telling you

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

Eyes the color of
(Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust
(Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps rolling

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughtta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you

"Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend"

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The first thing that she said.

Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate,
The one that used to get you in bother,
But one you could never bring yourself to hate.

And she said we've got that spark,
That only lights a fuse,
Helps you see in the dark,
But it's a sight you'll lose when,
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

Temptation greets you like your naughty mate,
One that made you steal and set things on fire,
But one you haven't seen of late.

And I said that kind of talk,
Only adds intrigue,
To the cauldron of thought,
It's already exceeding,
Temptation, the very thing that held her back.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

I don't ever want to hate you,
It's not part of the plan,
So keep your charm where I can't see it,

And your hands where I can.

[Dizzee Rascal]

We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends,
Caused enticement ? in the air,
I mean day 'n' night,
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight,
Smoking, drinking, joyriding,
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding,
Reckless gangsters ? no direction,
No sign of correction,
But then i switched it off,
Changed my ways,
What the hell!
Like oh my days ,
But like my naughty friends,
They're not phased,
Can't believe that this music pays,
See no reason why we can't do,
All the things we've always done,
Still in my heart I know thats just what,
But its hard to fight the temptation son.

[Arctic Monkeys]

The panic will fall down around you,
If you don't do what I say.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

I don't ever want to hate you,
It's not part of the plan,
So keep your charm where I can't see it,
And your hands where I can

"The Afternoon's Hat"

Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
and violently you swung, through unfamiliar tounge
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at.

"The Bakery"

I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At some mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet it surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with a mind on clever lines
Why not the rounder's pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
(To give me the invite don't worry it's alright)

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me

"The Lovers"

Up from the pastures of boredom
out from the sea of discontent
they come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment.

They haunt the boulevards and bars
they pray to wishing wells and stars
they ride the hurricane of hope
not looking back but on they go
toward the distance and deceiving
and all the while they keep believing
they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when they pair off two by two
they feel they are the chosen few
and though their beds are made of straw
they feel like velvet in the night
and so the night is never ending
its made of distance and pretending
coz they're special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love goes away
and when love goes...
goodbye...
catches in their throats like cotton
rises in their hearts like rain
the good times suddenly are all forgotten
the hunt begins again.

They search the subways and the streets
their faces tired, like their feet
their bodies aching to be warm
and so they hide behind the moon
their loneliness inside them growing
but they take comfort in just knowing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when love comes again
and when love comes
hello...
rises from their throats like singing
catches in their hearts like wind
the good things
strangers in their arms are bringing
makes life all right again.

They turn their faces to the light
no longer hiding in the night
so unashamed and unafraid
that they can face each others faults
and though the waltz will have its ending
there is no harm in just pretending
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

"Too Much To Ask"

The smiles as she walked in the room have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune to what they did before
Her head's red raw and the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And no would be...

Oh, it's uncertain whether the curtain has shut for good
She says "See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me-"
Well I interrupted, received the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

Would it be outrageous to say we're either shouting or we're shagging, docked in tempestuous bays?
At least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me like Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me we can't go back to the chest touching on the back

"What If You Were Right The First Time?"

The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

And does it get on your nerves,
Make you slightly perturbed,
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with yer,
seem awful empty without her.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time? [x2]

The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time?

"You And I"

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't try and turn on the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I'm in a muddle tonight
Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

I had a woman, she went away
And now I'm lonely...Fuck it

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

Would you tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart you're the one who should break it

The engines running, can't decide if I should ride away
You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't go and turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl, I'm in a muddle tonight

"You're So Dark"

You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple-A passes
At the cemetery gates

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror and you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spike-collared
I want you down on all fours

'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love will tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But, baby, I'm willing to start

You're so dark

Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
